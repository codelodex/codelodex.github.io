This site was created in R using Quarto, and open-source software supported by Posit. The theme and style of the website were come from Quarto's pre-existing themes using their publicly available code that can be found at [https://quarto.org](https://quarto.org).

The inspiration for this site was Vincent Arel-Bundock's wonderful documentation website for the `marginaleffects` package, which can be found at [https://marginaleffects.com](https://marginaleffects.com/). I have found this website extremely helpful in my own political science research, and hope my website can provide the same coding help that Vincent's has given me. A citation to the `marginaleffects` package appears below.
